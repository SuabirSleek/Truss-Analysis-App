# Truss Analysis App

A graphical desktop application built with Python and Tkinter for analyzing 2D truss structures. It enables users to define joints, members, loads, and supports, and then visualize and solve the truss for internal member forces and support reactions.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- GUI-based input using Tkinter
- Visual plotting of the truss structure using Matplotlib
- Force direction arrows and labeled member forces
- Stability checks based on classical truss theory (2j = m + r)
- Detailed result summary and dynamic warnings
- Error handling for invalid input and unstable structures

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
